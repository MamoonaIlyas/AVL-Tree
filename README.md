This C++ code implements an AVL tree data structure using recursive methods for insertion, deletion, and balancing operations. Here's a breakdown of its components:

1. AVLTreeRecursive class: This is the main AVL tree class template. It contains a nested `Node` struct representing each node in the tree. The class provides methods for operations like insertion, deletion, checking if the tree contains a value, updating the tree, and performing rotations. It also has private helper methods for balancing the tree and other internal operations.

2. Main function: The `main()` function provides a simple console-based menu for interacting with the AVL tree. It allows users to insert values into the tree, remove values, display the tree, display its height, perform rotations manually, or exit the program.

3. Menu: The menu loop continuously prompts the user for choices and executes the corresponding operations.

4. System commands: `system("cls")` is used to clear the console screen after each operation for better user interface experience. This command is platform-dependent and might not work on all systems.

5. Usage of string: The AVL tree is templated with the type `T`, allowing it to store any data type that supports comparison (e.g., strings). The comparison is done using `compare()` method provided by the string class.

Overall, this code provides a basic implementation of an AVL tree with recursive methods for balancing. Users can interact with the tree through the console menu provided.
